Featuring powerful noise cancelling, astonishing sound, unrivaled voice pickup, and so much more, Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 reinvent what headphones are and redefine what headphones can be. You can tap into the Google Assistant with the single touch of a button or access the world of Amazon just by saying, ""Alexa."" Prefer Siri? You can still access your phone's built-in voice assistant. The unrivaled microphone system in Bose Headphones 700 adapts to noisy and windy environments so your voice always sounds crystal clear on calls. Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions. For times when you'd feel more comfortable hearing the world around you, like if you were walking down a congested city street, you can minimize the noise cancelling so you can hear more of what's going on around you. Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ. Bose Headphones 700 have a stunning new design that features a streamlined stainless-steel headband and a lightweight, comfortable fit for all-day listening. You can manage volume, calls, and music just by touching or swiping the earcup surface. The Bose Music app allows you to personalize your headphone settings so they perform exactly the way you want them to. It also ensures all your Bose smart products work together for a better listening experience. The headphones feature up to 20 hours of wireless battery life and time-based battery power information.   Turn any space into a workplace with powerful noise cancelling, astonishing sound, unrivaled voice pickup. Personalize your environment with 11 levels of noise cancelling - control distractions or let ambient sound in. The unrivaled microphone system isolates your voice so it sounds crystal clear absolutely anywhere. Manage volume, calls, and music just by touching and swiping the earcup surface. Get an immersive listening experience at any volume with signature active EQ. Pick the voice assistant that's right for you. Just press the dedicated VPA button for your Google Assistant - or say ""Alexa."" Or access your phone's native assistant, like Siri. Listen comfortably for hours with a sophisticated design that features a streamlined, lightweight stainless-steel headband and angled earcups for a perfect fit. Customize your controls to prioritize the functions you use most, like noise cancellation levels, voice levels, voice prompts, wake-up words, and more.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy.

For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions.

Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ.

Featuring powerful noise cancelling, astonishing sound, unrivaled voice pickup, and so much more, Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 reinvent what headphones are and redefine what headphones can be. You can tap into the Google Assistant with the single touch of a button or access the world of Amazon just by saying, ""Alexa."" Prefer Siri? You can still access your phone's built-in voice assistant. The unrivaled microphone system in Bose Headphones 700 adapts to noisy and windy environments so your voice always sounds crystal clear on calls. Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions. For times when you'd feel more comfortable hearing the world around you, like if you were walking down a congested city street, you can minimize the noise cancelling so you can hear more of what's going on around you. Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ. Bose Headphones 700 have a stunning new design that features a streamlined stainless-steel headband and a lightweight, comfortable fit for all-day listening. You can manage volume, calls, and music just by touching or swiping the earcup surface. The Bose Music app allows you to personalize your headphone settings so they perform exactly the way you want them to. It also ensures all your Bose smart products work together for a better listening experience. The headphones feature up to 20 hours of wireless battery life and time-based battery power information.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions.

Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ. Bose Headphones 700 have a stunning new design that features a streamlined stainless-steel headband and a lightweight, comfortable fit for all-day listening.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions.

Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy.

Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from.

You can tap into the Google Assistant with the single touch of a button or access the world of Amazon just by saying, ""Alexa."" Prefer Siri? You can still access your phone's built-in voice assistant. The unrivaled microphone system in Bose Headphones 700 adapts to noisy and windy environments so your voice always sounds crystal clear on calls. Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions. For times when you'd feel more comfortable hearing the world around you, like if you were walking down a congested city street, you can minimize the noise cancelling so you can hear more of what's going on around you. Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ. Bose Headphones 700 have a stunning new design that features a streamlined stainless-steel headband and a lightweight, comfortable fit for all-day listening. You can manage volume, calls, and music just by touching or swiping the earcup surface. The Bose Music app allows you to personalize your headphone settings so they perform exactly the way you want them to. It also ensures all your Bose smart products work together for a better listening experience. The headphones feature up to 20 hours of wireless battery life and time-based battery power information.   Turn any space into a workplace with powerful noise cancelling, astonishing sound, unrivaled voice pickup. Personalize your environment with 11 levels of noise cancelling - control distractions or let ambient sound in.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions.

Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ. Bose Headphones 700 have a stunning new design that features a streamlined stainless-steel headband and a lightweight, comfortable fit for all-day listening. You can manage volume, calls, and music just by touching or swiping the earcup surface.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy.

And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from.

You can tap into the Google Assistant with the single touch of a button or access the world of Amazon just by saying, ""Alexa."" Prefer Siri? You can still access your phone's built-in voice assistant. The unrivaled microphone system in Bose Headphones 700 adapts to noisy and windy environments so your voice always sounds crystal clear on calls. Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions. For times when you'd feel more comfortable hearing the world around you, like if you were walking down a congested city street, you can minimize the noise cancelling so you can hear more of what's going on around you. Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ.

Featuring powerful noise cancelling, astonishing sound, unrivaled voice pickup, and so much more, Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 reinvent what headphones are and redefine what headphones can be. You can tap into the Google Assistant with the single touch of a button or access the world of Amazon just by saying, ""Alexa."" Prefer Siri? You can still access your phone's built-in voice assistant. The unrivaled microphone system in Bose Headphones 700 adapts to noisy and windy environments so your voice always sounds crystal clear on calls. Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions. For times when you'd feel more comfortable hearing the world around you, like if you were walking down a congested city street, you can minimize the noise cancelling so you can hear more of what's going on around you. Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ. Bose Headphones 700 have a stunning new design that features a streamlined stainless-steel headband and a lightweight, comfortable fit for all-day listening.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy.

For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions.

Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ. Bose Headphones 700 have a stunning new design that features a streamlined stainless-steel headband and a lightweight, comfortable fit for all-day listening. You can manage volume, calls, and music just by touching or swiping the earcup surface.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions.

Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ. Bose Headphones 700 have a stunning new design that features a streamlined stainless-steel headband and a lightweight, comfortable fit for all-day listening.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy.

Featuring powerful noise cancelling, astonishing sound, unrivaled voice pickup, and so much more, Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 reinvent what headphones are and redefine what headphones can be. You can tap into the Google Assistant with the single touch of a button or access the world of Amazon just by saying, ""Alexa."" Prefer Siri? You can still access your phone's built-in voice assistant. The unrivaled microphone system in Bose Headphones 700 adapts to noisy and windy environments so your voice always sounds crystal clear on calls. Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions. For times when you'd feel more comfortable hearing the world around you, like if you were walking down a congested city street, you can minimize the noise cancelling so you can hear more of what's going on around you. Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions. For times when you'd feel more comfortable hearing the world around you, like if you were walking down a congested city street, you can minimize the noise cancelling so you can hear more of what's going on around you. Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions. For times when you'd feel more comfortable hearing the world around you, like if you were walking down a congested city street, you can minimize the noise cancelling so you can hear more of what's going on around you. Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ. Bose Headphones 700 have a stunning new design that features a streamlined stainless-steel headband and a lightweight, comfortable fit for all-day listening. You can manage volume, calls, and music just by touching or swiping the earcup surface.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy.

Featuring powerful noise cancelling, astonishing sound, unrivaled voice pickup, and so much more, Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 reinvent what headphones are and redefine what headphones can be. You can tap into the Google Assistant with the single touch of a button or access the world of Amazon just by saying, ""Alexa."" Prefer Siri? You can still access your phone's built-in voice assistant. The unrivaled microphone system in Bose Headphones 700 adapts to noisy and windy environments so your voice always sounds crystal clear on calls. Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions. For times when you'd feel more comfortable hearing the world around you, like if you were walking down a congested city street, you can minimize the noise cancelling so you can hear more of what's going on around you. Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions.

Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ. Bose Headphones 700 have a stunning new design that features a streamlined stainless-steel headband and a lightweight, comfortable fit for all-day listening.

Featuring powerful noise cancelling, astonishing sound, unrivaled voice pickup, and so much more, Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 reinvent what headphones are and redefine what headphones can be. You can tap into the Google Assistant with the single touch of a button or access the world of Amazon just by saying, ""Alexa."" Prefer Siri? You can still access your phone's built-in voice assistant. The unrivaled microphone system in Bose Headphones 700 adapts to noisy and windy environments so your voice always sounds crystal clear on calls. Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions. For times when you'd feel more comfortable hearing the world around you, like if you were walking down a congested city street, you can minimize the noise cancelling so you can hear more of what's going on around you. Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions. For times when you'd feel more comfortable hearing the world around you, like if you were walking down a congested city street, you can minimize the noise cancelling so you can hear more of what's going on around you. Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ.

You can tap into the Google Assistant with the single touch of a button or access the world of Amazon just by saying, ""Alexa."" Prefer Siri? You can still access your phone's built-in voice assistant.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions.

Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ. Bose Headphones 700 have a stunning new design that features a streamlined stainless-steel headband and a lightweight, comfortable fit for all-day listening. You can manage volume, calls, and music just by touching or swiping the earcup surface.

Featuring powerful noise cancelling, astonishing sound, unrivaled voice pickup, and so much more, Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 reinvent what headphones are and redefine what headphones can be. You can tap into the Google Assistant with the single touch of a button or access the world of Amazon just by saying, ""Alexa."" Prefer Siri? You can still access your phone's built-in voice assistant. The unrivaled microphone system in Bose Headphones 700 adapts to noisy and windy environments so your voice always sounds crystal clear on calls. Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions. For times when you'd feel more comfortable hearing the world around you, like if you were walking down a congested city street, you can minimize the noise cancelling so you can hear more of what's going on around you. Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ. Bose Headphones 700 have a stunning new design that features a streamlined stainless-steel headband and a lightweight, comfortable fit for all-day listening. You can manage volume, calls, and music just by touching or swiping the earcup surface. The Bose Music app allows you to personalize your headphone settings so they perform exactly the way you want them to. It also ensures all your Bose smart products work together for a better listening experience. The headphones feature up to 20 hours of wireless battery life and time-based battery power information.   Turn any space into a workplace with powerful noise cancelling, astonishing sound, unrivaled voice pickup. Personalize your environment with 11 levels of noise cancelling - control distractions or let ambient sound in. The unrivaled microphone system isolates your voice so it sounds crystal clear absolutely anywhere. Manage volume, calls, and music just by touching and swiping the earcup surface.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy.

For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions.

Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ. Bose Headphones 700 have a stunning new design that features a streamlined stainless-steel headband and a lightweight, comfortable fit for all-day listening.

You can tap into the Google Assistant with the single touch of a button or access the world of Amazon just by saying, ""Alexa."" Prefer Siri? You can still access your phone's built-in voice assistant. The unrivaled microphone system in Bose Headphones 700 adapts to noisy and windy environments so your voice always sounds crystal clear on calls. Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions. For times when you'd feel more comfortable hearing the world around you, like if you were walking down a congested city street, you can minimize the noise cancelling so you can hear more of what's going on around you. Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ. Bose Headphones 700 have a stunning new design that features a streamlined stainless-steel headband and a lightweight, comfortable fit for all-day listening. You can manage volume, calls, and music just by touching or swiping the earcup surface.

Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions.

Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ. Bose Headphones 700 have a stunning new design that features a streamlined stainless-steel headband and a lightweight, comfortable fit for all-day listening. You can manage volume, calls, and music just by touching or swiping the earcup surface. The Bose Music app allows you to personalize your headphone settings so they perform exactly the way you want them to.

Featuring powerful noise cancelling, astonishing sound, unrivaled voice pickup, and so much more, Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 reinvent what headphones are and redefine what headphones can be. You can tap into the Google Assistant with the single touch of a button or access the world of Amazon just by saying, ""Alexa."" Prefer Siri? You can still access your phone's built-in voice assistant. The unrivaled microphone system in Bose Headphones 700 adapts to noisy and windy environments so your voice always sounds crystal clear on calls. Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions. For times when you'd feel more comfortable hearing the world around you, like if you were walking down a congested city street, you can minimize the noise cancelling so you can hear more of what's going on around you. Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ.

Featuring powerful noise cancelling, astonishing sound, unrivaled voice pickup, and so much more, Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 reinvent what headphones are and redefine what headphones can be. You can tap into the Google Assistant with the single touch of a button or access the world of Amazon just by saying, ""Alexa."" Prefer Siri? You can still access your phone's built-in voice assistant. The unrivaled microphone system in Bose Headphones 700 adapts to noisy and windy environments so your voice always sounds crystal clear on calls. Your voice sounds clear to your voice assistant, too, so your commands, voice-generated texts, and web searches are captured with unprecedented accuracy. When it comes to noise cancellation, Bose did more than improve the performance - they evolved how you use it. For example, if you're trying to focus in a busy cafe, you can maximize the noise cancelling to eliminate distractions. For times when you'd feel more comfortable hearing the world around you, like if you were walking down a congested city street, you can minimize the noise cancelling so you can hear more of what's going on around you. Fact is, you'll be able to hear the world around you so well, you'll be surprised you're wearing headphones at all. And for all the times where you'd prefer something between these two extremes, there are nine other levels to choose from. When you want to place a coffee order or speak to a coworker, use Conversation Mode. This handy new feature temporarily pauses your content, drops the noise cancelling down to zero, and lets you hear your surroundings for quick conversations. Don't forget about your music. Whether you're listening at low volumes or really want to turn it up, you'll get an immersive listening experience with signature active EQ. Bose Headphones 700 have a stunning new design that features a streamlined stainless-steel headband and a lightweight, comfortable fit for all-day listening. You can manage volume, calls, and music just by touching or swiping the earcup surface. The Bose Music app allows you to personalize your headphone settings so they perform exactly the way you want them to. It also ensures all your Bose smart products work together for a better listening experience. The headphones feature up to 20 hours of wireless battery life and time-based battery power information.
