Within these colorful drum-shaped earphones lies carefully chosen speaker components, perfectly tuned to deliver clear, balanced sound directly into your ears. Small in-ear headphones often lack bass, lack treble, or just lack good sound altogether. TUNAI has solved these problems with an advanced driver and diaphragm combination. The extra large 1/2"" / 13 mm driver provides clearer, louder bass and a wider soundstage, while the ultra thin speaker diaphragm is super responsive and sensitive, giving the Drum an edge over the competition and putting it in a class populated by much pricier rivals. Ultra soft ear buds with great noise isolation Drum comes with four sizes of silky soft ear buds, ensuring that every ear can get a snug fit. The ear buds also do a great job at blocking outside sound from interrupting your music (reducing noise level by 30dB vs 18dB of normal earbud). They also pop on and off easily for convenient washing to keep them (and your ears) clean and happy! Tuned for maximum audio awesomeness Each component has been specially designed and selected to work together, ensuring truly fantastic sound at this price point. As with any better-quality headphone, these take some time to break in to let the drivers loosen up and the components settle. Once they do, the rich, warm tone with clear highs will bring your music to life. Drum is a Japan Audio Society (JAS) certified High Resolution Audio Earphone. As with any hi-res audio product, we strongly recommend using the best possible quality MP3s or AAC files, and if possible, high resolution FLAC or other lossless audio sources.

Information about the undesirable sound waves is processed through the circuitry and creates an ""anti-wave."" The sound wave and ""anti-wave"" counteract each other at the wearer\'s ear, reducing the irritating low frequency noise and increasing listening pleasure.Designed to reduce low frequency, repetitive noise, the QZ PRO is most effective at blocking out noises you want to eliminate while not affecting things you want to hear- like voice and music. The QZ PRO affects those noises between 30Hz and 1400 Hz, allowing music and voice to come through loud and clear.No lightweight when it comes to sound reproduction, the QZ PRO utilizes a dynamic element for a full frequency response of 40-20,000 Hz. A deep bass and balanced midrange deliver an impressive sound performance whether you\'re enjoying a DVD, CD or MP3 recording. An extra-soft, padded headband allows for lightweight comfort for extended listening periods.Completely collapsible, the QZ PRO makes an ideal travel companion on a plane, bus or automobile. No need for noise cancellation? No problem. And unlike some competitive models, you can enjoy the Sound of Koss with or without noise reduction. The QZ PRO noise reduction circuitry can be turned on and off with a flip of a switch.', 'N/A', 'March 27, 2019']"
