Cable length: 3m  Reviews: Nathan B. Very nice headphones for content consumption at home. Light and comfortable without feeling flimsy and they sound great for the price. However, the 10 foot long undetachable cable and a design that doesn't include in-line controls or fold or collapse do not make these a good travel companion. If you are willing to pay $100 more you can get headphones that immediately sound noticably clearer, fuller, and louder, but if you were willing to pay that much you probably wouldn't be looking at these. Great replacement for the earbuds that came with your phone, but they won't satisfy picky audiophiles or commuters. Calvin D. Senechal The rating system for headphones leaves much to be desired. The HD 206 headphone is one of the most satisfying headphones that I have ever owned. It's frequency response goes very low as well as very high without harshness. The amount of bass is properly balanced. The 206's perform very well with any genre of music and voices. The 206's clean up vocals especially opera singers. The older recorded music is benefited by these phones with better clarity and low distortion. They work very well with my mp3 players as well as my iPhone and iPad mini. I would rate them as a five but there are many very good headphones made today which are much more expensive and better sounding. But what is better? The 206's represents the music accurately. I did plug them directly into my computer's sound card. They did not do that well because the sound cards in most computers are not that good. The source which drives these headphones need to be quality for quality results. I call these phones my smog lifters. I am keeping them but I own two other very good phones too.","['Brand ', 'Model ', 'Type ', 'Color ', 'Frequency Response ', 'THD ', 'Input Impedance ', 'Sensitivity ', 'Connector ', 'Ear Coupling ', 'Cord Length ', 'Weight ', 'Compatibility ', 'Features ', 'Package Contents ', 'Option ', 'Date First Available ']","['Sennheiser', 'HD 206 PRO', 'Stereo / DJ', 'Black', '8Hz-25KHz', '<0.1%', '64 ohms (nominal)', '102 dB (SPL)', '3.5mm/ 6.3mm', 'Circumaural', '3.3 - 9.8 feet Coiled', '7.80 oz. w/o cable', 'Universal', 'Dynamic, Noise Isolating, Around-the-earLightweight and comfortable, ergonomic designExtended frequency response, natural sound reproductionLightweight and comfortable, ergonomic designClosed, dynamic stereo headphonesAccurate, linear sound reproduction for critical monitoring applicationsOptimum impedance ensures universal compatibilitySpace saving design features collapsible, rotating earcupsUp to 32 dB of ambient noise attenuationNeodymium magnets for high maximum SPLSingle-sided, coiled cable with 3.5 mm mini jack with locking 1/4"" adapterRugged construction with user-replaceable partsContact pressure: 6 NLoad rating: 500 mW', '1 pair of HD 280 PRO headphone1 screw-type adapter to 1/4""', 'New', 'October 11, 2018']"
