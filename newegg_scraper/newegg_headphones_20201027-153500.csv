Ultrasone Performance 880 S-Logic Plus Surround Sound Closed-back Headphones,9SIA4P0BY87500,88%,"5,048",499.99,"The Ultrasone Performance series was conceptualized for musicians and music lovers. The unique reproduction of music brings both groups of users together. These audiophile headphones for mixing, which show their own creativity across the whole tonal spectrum, are also ideal for music lovers who want to experience their favorite songs as the artist intended them to be experienced. The Performance 880 is also perfect for everyone who doesn’t want to deny themselves excellent sound while going about their favorite pastimes – from gaming to watching TV. The Performance 840 comes with detachable cables with a bayonet connector that will allow you to quickly change to the cable of your choice. The Performance 880 comes supplied with a 3m straight cable with a 3.5mm gold-plated jack, a 1.2m cable with a microphone and remote control, and a 6.3mm gold-plated screw-on adapter.Spatial Sound and Fatigue-Free Listening Thanks to S-Logic® PlusBoth the sophisticated tonal balance and patented S-Logic® Plus technology provide unique reproduction of your favorite music. The decentralized arrangement of the sound transducers creates a spatial sound normally only expected from high-quality speakers. A broad stereo platform with excellent depth graduation allows listeners to completely immerse themselves in the music. This spatial impression is created by the S-Logic® Plus design, which reflects sound more frequently before it reaches the inner ear. This design principle also ensures fatigue-free music enjoyment and protects the hearing. With S-Logic® Plus,compared to conventional headphones, a lower sound pressure level is necessary at the same volume level (3 - 4dB).Design Inspired by Ultrasone EditionWhen developing the Performance series, Ultrasone drew inspiration from the design of the highly acclaimed Edition 8. For example, echoes of the Edition 8’s unique lines can also be found in both of the new Performance models. The headband pad, with a laser-engraved Ultrasone logo, is an attractive highlight. The ear cups of the Performance 860 are contoured with black and silver, whereas the Performance 840 has a completely black finish. To perfect its elegant look, Ultrasone uses high-quality materials that guarantee long-lasting satisfaction.Maximum Wear ComfortDuring the development of the Performance series, Ultrasone focussed intensively on materials that would act as an excellent headphone shielding as well as providing maximum comfort. The result of this painstaking research and testing is a special memory foam that adapts perfectly to the contours of the head, guaranteeing hours of comfort. The headband cushioning is made with the same material. For around-ear headphones, the choice of material is essential for comfort: for the Performance 880, Ultrasone chose a protein leather that caresses the skin.Perfect for the Studio, Hi-Fi and On the GoThe Ultrasone Performance 880 is equipped with a detachable cable that is securely attached to the headphones with a bayonet fastening. A 3m cable with 6.3mm stereo jack for studio and hi-fi use is included as standard.
