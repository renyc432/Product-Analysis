Cable length: 3m  Reviews: Nathan B. Very nice headphones for content consumption at home. Light and comfortable without feeling flimsy and they sound great for the price. However, the 10 foot long undetachable cable and a design that doesn't include in-line controls or fold or collapse do not make these a good travel companion. If you are willing to pay $100 more you can get headphones that immediately sound noticably clearer, fuller, and louder, but if you were willing to pay that much you probably wouldn't be looking at these. Great replacement for the earbuds that came with your phone, but they won't satisfy picky audiophiles or commuters. Calvin D. Senechal The rating system for headphones leaves much to be desired. The HD 206 headphone is one of the most satisfying headphones that I have ever owned. It's frequency response goes very low as well as very high without harshness. The amount of bass is properly balanced. The 206's perform very well with any genre of music and voices. The 206's clean up vocals especially opera singers. The older recorded music is benefited by these phones with better clarity and low distortion. They work very well with my mp3 players as well as my iPhone and iPad mini. I would rate them as a five but there are many very good headphones made today which are much more expensive and better sounding. But what is better? The 206's represents the music accurately. I did plug them directly into my computer's sound card. They did not do that well because the sound cards in most computers are not that good. The source which drives these headphones need to be quality for quality results. I call these phones my smog lifters. I am keeping them but I own two other very good phones too.","['Brand ', 'Model ', 'Type ', 'Color ', 'Frequency Response ', 'THD ', 'Input Impedance ', 'Sensitivity ', 'Connector ', 'Ear Coupling ', 'Cord Length ', 'Weight ', 'Compatibility ', 'Features ', 'Package Contents ', 'Option ', 'Date First Available ']","['Sennheiser', 'HD 206 PRO', 'Stereo / DJ', 'Black', '8Hz-25KHz', '<0.1%', '64 ohms (nominal)', '102 dB (SPL)', '3.5mm/ 6.3mm', 'Circumaural', '3.3 - 9.8 feet Coiled', '7.80 oz. w/o cable', 'Universal', 'Dynamic, Noise Isolating, Around-the-earLightweight and comfortable, ergonomic designExtended frequency response, natural sound reproductionLightweight and comfortable, ergonomic designClosed, dynamic stereo headphonesAccurate, linear sound reproduction for critical monitoring applicationsOptimum impedance ensures universal compatibilitySpace saving design features collapsible, rotating earcupsUp to 32 dB of ambient noise attenuationNeodymium magnets for high maximum SPLSingle-sided, coiled cable with 3.5 mm mini jack with locking 1/4"" adapterRugged construction with user-replaceable partsContact pressure: 6 NLoad rating: 500 mW', '1 pair of HD 280 PRO headphone1 screw-type adapter to 1/4""', 'New', 'October 11, 2018']"

"TUNAI DRUM Hi-Res Certified Bass Enhanced Earphone - In-ear Headphones with Extra Large 1/2"" Drivers for Improved Bass Response, Good Clarity, Wide Soundstage & Precise Sound Positioning (Green)",9SIAFU07636930,50%,2,29.99," Following a highly successful Kickstarter campaign, the Tunai Drum Hi-Res Earphones are now available to the rest of us! Within these colorful drum-shaped earphones lies carefully chosen speaker components, perfectly tuned to deliver clear, balanced sound directly into your ears. Small in-ear headphones often lack bass, lack treble, or just lack good sound altogether. TUNAI has solved these problems with an advanced driver and diaphragm combination. The extra large 1/2"" / 13 mm driver provides clearer, louder bass and a wider soundstage, while the ultra thin speaker diaphragm is super responsive and sensitive, giving the Drum an edge over the competition and putting it in a class populated by much pricier rivals. Ultra soft ear buds with great noise isolation Drum comes with four sizes of silky soft ear buds, ensuring that every ear can get a snug fit. The ear buds also do a great job at blocking outside sound from interrupting your music (reducing noise level by 30dB vs 18dB of normal earbud). They also pop on and off easily for convenient washing to keep them (and your ears) clean and happy! Tuned for maximum audio awesomeness Each component has been specially designed and selected to work together, ensuring truly fantastic sound at this price point. As with any better-quality headphone, these take some time to break in to let the drivers loosen up and the components settle. Once they do, the rich, warm tone with clear highs will bring your music to life. Drum is a Japan Audio Society (JAS) certified High Resolution Audio Earphone. As with any hi-res audio product, we strongly recommend using the best possible quality MP3s or AAC files, and if possible, high resolution FLAC or other lossless audio sources. Space age materials take your sound to the stars Ultra-thin 8um aerospace grade PET diaphragm uses high advanced materials and fabrication techniques. The result is a speaker capable of lightning-fast response times for clear high-end.

Sturdy built and precise assembly. The ear cups are made with a satin finished wood grain. Put them on sit back and enjoy your favorite sound of plucked strings upbeat grooves or thumping beats while still looking classy. Premium Sound Designed for Those Who Know We're taking headphone design to a new level by combining modern with hand crafted design using natural materials and focusing on delivering the best premium sound. The aim is to change the perception of headphones as technical devices or as cheap plastic accessories and create a mature product to fall in love with. Wood Technology The choice of wood is an inherently difficult one. The rich colors of walnut require the use of air drying a long and expensive procedure. The process of shaping just a single pair of earcups takes up to 8 hours. The whole process of sanding lacquering and finishing lasts 45 days. The wooden components are carefully inspected and no flaws are permitted to reach the final assembly. It is worth mentioning that all the wood that is used in these headphones is strictly harvested from sources with certificate of origin. That is mature trees that have reached the end of their life cycle. This way Meze is helping the environment and giving the old trees a chance to shine one more time in the shape of Meze headphones.
